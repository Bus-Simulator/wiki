  ##[Info]
  The Bloxdonalds is both an Event and a Location in Bus Simulator.
  \n\n
  When this event happens, the Bus will stop and a random player will mention seeing a Bloxdonalds in the distance. Players are then able to go inside the building and receive a Burger. After some time has passed, the driver will mention an oddity within the burgers and afterwards leave, ending the event.
  \n\n
  During the event, you'll also be able to interact with characters such as: Red and Steven Scripts. There's also a hidden interactable NPC next to the door, and used to be another NPC in its place but was removed for reasons.

  ###[Trying to interact with the last NPC says the following]:
  - hg[You]: "..?"
    - hg[You]: "The vibes are kinda off in this specific spot... was someone here before?"

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "Woah! I think I see a Bloxdonalds in the distance!"
    - hg[You]: "*gasp*"
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Event]: "I'm 99% sure there's something in these burgers.. Evacuate to the bus."

  ##[Trivia]
  - This is the third largest amount of interactable NPCs, having half as much as [GOATed Gas Station](goat-station).
  - If you use a [GPS](gps) while the event is ongoing, rather than it be a random location, it'll instead say Bloxdonalds.
  - This is also a reference to Bus Stop Simulator's Bloxdonalds, where it shares similar details to the Bus Simulator version, but without the dangers that lurk there.
  - The runtime of this event is 1 minute and 40 seconds (exactly 100 seconds). This makes the event a similar runtime to the [Cave](cave) event.
  - Based off of [Red](red)'s comments and the bulletin board within the [Backwalls](backwalls), a few assumptions can be made about the business. 
    - It's a corporation that attempts to serve "the universe and beyond" with access to technologies to teleport into areas even out of reality. This means it may not be the second time we see Bloxdonalds running in business.
    - [efeuc](efeuc) is wanted within Bloxdonalds for making it lose an "irrecoverable h[12c] in losses". He is also meant to be detained on sight. 
    - Both [Steven](steven) and [MLG](mlg) used to work at Bloxdonalds, but one [vanished](steven-ride), while the other [moved away](goat-station).
