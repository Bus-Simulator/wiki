  ##[Info]
  During the event Cubes, cubes move all around the bus, playing many xylophone notes. After some time, the driver announces they've convinced the cubes to go back to Nintendo Land. A few moments after that, the event ends.

  ##[Trivia]
  - This event is an obvious reference to the Nintendo GameCube startup sequence.
  - Perhaps another, unintentional reference, the "Nintendo Land" that the cubes return to is the same name as a Wii U launch title.
  - Sometimes a cube can make a sound that goes "Boom! Fricko!"
    - It comes from the game [Boom and Fricko](https://www.roblox.com/games/2081092459/Boom-and-Fricko).
  - The runtime of this event is 1 minute and 5 seconds, making it a really similar runtime to both the BaconHair and Glitches events.
