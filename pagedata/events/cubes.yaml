  ##[Info]
  Cubes is an event that appears every 5 minutes similar to all other events and lasts for a minute. 
  \n
  During this event, The Bus is unknowingly raided by rogue Gamecubes that escaped from Nintendo Land, creating noises and often blockages throughout the entire bus. After a while though, the bus driver announcements that they managed to convince the gamecubes to return back to Nintendo Land, and soon after, the event ends.

  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[Event]: "THE CUBES ARE ATTACKING!!!"
    - hg[You]: "Who plugged in the Gamecube?!"
      - h[After some time has passed...]
        - hg[Event]: "I've convinced the cubes to go back to Nintendo Land. They'll leave any second now."

  ##[Trivia]
  - This event is an obvious reference to the Nintendo GameCube startup sequence.
  - Perhaps another, unintentional reference, the "Nintendo Land" that the cubes return to is the same name as a Wii U launch title.
  - Sometimes a cube can make a sound that goes "Boom! Fricko!"
    - It comes from the game [Boom and Fricko](https://www.roblox.com/games/2081092459/Boom-and-Fricko).
  - The runtime of this event is 1 minute and 5 seconds, making it a really similar runtime to both the BaconHair and Glitches events.
  - A [news](news) article references this particular event: "Nintendo lost all their gamecubes; ''We shouldn't have kept them in a cardboard box'' representative states.".
