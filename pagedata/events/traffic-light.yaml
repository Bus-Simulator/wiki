  ##[Info]
  The Traffic Light event is a rather simple and straight-forward, when this event is rolled, the bus will stop and waits until the traffic light turns back to green because they are a good driver,
  disregarding the [speeding](time-travel), [resisting arrest](police), [reckless driving](nobles-house), [vehicular manslaughter](santas-gone), [stealing](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/4894984/Bus-Driver), [evading taxes](news), [potential grand theft auto](news), [involvement in robbery](no-dough), and perhaps other crimes the bus driver has committed prior to this. 
  The event ends after a minute or so.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Although the bus stops once the traffic light hits red, no other vehicle except the Ice Cream Truck obeys the traffic light.
    - This makes getting ice cream during this event accessible, unless the Ice Cream Truck is either non-existent or has been crashed by another vehicle.
  - This can be considered as one of the more basic events in the game that doesn't involve a feature. Other examples are [Mountain](mountain) and [Nothing](nothing).
