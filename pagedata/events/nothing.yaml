  ##[Info]
  The nothing event is well... nothing? There isn't much to detail for this event other than a conversation of dialogue between the player and the event, but that's it.
  \n\n 
  There is no hidden features into it, no special dialogue or any happenings, it is essentially nothing. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again right after the first.
  ##[Dialogue]
  - hg[You]: "..."
  - hg[You]: "So.."
    - hg[Player]: "Where's the event?"
       - hg[GAME]: "There is no event."
        - hg[You]: "..what?"
          - hg[GAME]: "The event is that there is no event, and that's the event." 
             - hg[You]: "...I don't get it."
              - hg[GAME]: "You may not get it now, but trust me. This is the deepest event in the game. You just don't know it yet." 
                 - hg[You]: "?????????" 
  ##[Trivia]
  - This event for many, is considered useless and objectively so, for it is literally nothing, with [Traffic Light](traffic-light), and [Mountain](mountain) being behind it based on community reception. 
    - You can also do an Advanced Force Event specifically for this, but you *definitely* shouldn't pick this event. (120 R$ down the drain!)
