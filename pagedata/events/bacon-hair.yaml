  ##[Info]
  Bacon Hair Event is an event that happens in the game. When this event happens, The bus stops and Bacon hairs are seen all over the bus. The Bacon hairs will follow anyone that is outside and also follows them. They can come inside the bus if the person that is chased by bacon hairs runs inside the bus, there is a chance they will come inside. They can kill anyone that is outside of the bus or if it touches a player. An Unknown man's voice can be heard in the bus speaker saying, "Bacon hair lives matter". Soon afterwards, the driver will then inform all players to evacuate to the bus now. Then, the driver will speed away from the Bacon Hairs.
  \n\n
  For maximum safety, do not be on the first floor. It's best not to go outside, nor open the bus door as one might get in and kill everyone on the first floor who touches it, but everyone on a floor higher is safe. However, If you are outside when the bus is about to speed away, run to it and try to sit inside or wait, as the bus will hopefully respawn you back inside.
  
  ##[Trivia]
  - This is one of the events that stops the bus.
  - The bacon hair event is one of the few events that have NPCs.
  - It is one of the few events that causes the bus to speed up.
  - There's more peaceful Bacon Hair NPCs than harmful ones, meaning if you go further out, you will not be attacked by them.
  - The event runtime is 1 minute and 4 seconds, making it the exact same runtime as the [Glitches](glitches) event and really similar to the [Cubes](cubes) event.
