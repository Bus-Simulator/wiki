  *Not to be confused with [Edit](edit), the actual building tools.*
  ##[Info]
  Btools is an event contributed by both Zeon and ComeOutTheCloset_1, where the bus driver stops by the side of the road, seeing a small table with F3x Building Tools, as well as a sign stating that an admin is out for lunch. 
  \n
  Clicking on the item will give you the item [FakeBuildTools](fake-btools). The event lasts around roughly 30 seconds.
