  ##[Info]
  The Sushi Shop is an event in Bus Simulator, in which [The Bus](the-bus) stops at a nearby sushi resturant, allowing passengers to buy them with [Passenger Reputation](reputation) or steal them, with each sushi having different effects.
  \n
  When the event starts, The Bus encounters a sushi shop in the distance, and stops next to it.
  \n\n
  Throughout the duration of the event, players are able to buy [Sushi](sushi) for 4 Passenger Reputation, allowing a way to spend any unneeded reputation and providing potentially beneficial effects in doing so.

  You can also steal the sushi if you'd like, but expect to recieve h[various consequences] in doing so.
  \n\n 
  After a while, the driver asks everyone to return back to The Bus and soon after leaves, ending the event.
