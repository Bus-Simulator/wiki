  !!INFOBOX TITLE:"Easter Egg Content" COLOR:"#A1FFEF" TEXT:"*\"How did you find this? ..I'm impressed!\"* - Fang\nv(This page is mainly easter egg content and is *never* found in the game. This is also where Wiki Contributors mess around.)"

  ##[Info]
  Fang or known as FangedWerewolf is a contributor in Bus Simulator that has worked on the many wikis relating of this game, alongside contributing the [Birch Forest](birch-forest) biome, and the [Shivering](commands) emote. He is also a digital artist.
  
  ##[Appearance]
  Fang wears the Werewolf Set alongside Wolf Aviators from JohnDrinkIn, he also pairs it with shirts that he has made himself; and wears a black pair of jeans.

  ##[Favourite Drink]
  Fang's favourite drink is the <clr:#000099>[Blueberry Milkshake](cafe-coffee-recipes). This gives you either 6 passenger or driver rep.

  ##[Trust]
  Similar to [Frost](frostbite), he also has his own trust level, with each increasing by one, up to 3 at most. You can increase it by striking specific conversations with him and by offering navigation tools to him.
  With each level, more dialogue and options will be accessible and remains permanent afterwards.
  Once you have achieved more than 2 trust with him, he will also appear in the [Cafe](cafe).

  ##[Dialogue]
  ###[**Intruder (Intro)**]
  #![!!DLEMULATOR EID:"fangemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/intrudedfang.json"]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Uh.. who are you..?"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Well this is a surprise."
  - hg[Variant 3]: "*Sigh*, the connection here is really bad, I'm not sure if I'l- huh?"
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Excuse me, but are you also lost here?"
    - hg[Option 1]: IS THAT A WEREWOLF???
      - "H-Hey! Don't be too intimated by my presence, I'm all bark and no bite! <8px>(How did you even know who I was anyways..?)"
      - "Regardless.. looks like your bus has gotten stranded here I'm guessing?" 
        - hg[Option 1]: Lucky guess...
          - "Dang, looks like I'm not the only person to be in this forest..."
          - "Say, I could help you in the process. But I'll have my suspicions."
            - hg[Why's that?]
              - "Well, it's obvious isn't it? I can't really trust you that much especially since we just first met."
              - "But I still have to find my way back home though... hmm..."
                - hg[We could help you with that.]
                  - "I appreciate the offer... but I'll decline for now."
                  - "In the meantime though, I'll help you guys back to speed, or well; until you find a mechanic to properly deal with this.."
        - hg[Option 2]: How did you know?
          - "I've been in this forest for a while now. And when I heard a sudden noise, I had to check what's going on." 
            - hg[Option 1]: Oh alright. 
              - "Now that's all cleared up.. I'll help you guys back to speed." 
            - hg[Option 2]: Why could you talk to us immediately?
              - "Well, I doubt *anyone* would enjoy a random werewolf potentially ambusing folks no?"
                - hg[Can't argue against that.] 
                  - "Now that's all cleared up.. Looks like I'll be able to help you guys back to speed." 
                  - "Just know that we are just acquaintances."
    - hg[Option 2]: Who are you?
      - "Uhh... not sure if I should really say it, but; name's Fang."
      - "Yours?"
        - hg[[Player].]
          - "[Player], huh? Well I suppose it's been a while since I've last seen someone stranded here."
          - "Guessing your bus broke down in the middle of the road?"
            - hg[...yup.]
              - "Darn. It also seems like the bus you were on is busted.. and there's no mechanic in sight."
              - "I might be able to help fix the bus back to speed, not for much longer; but hopefully enough to find a mechanic somewhere on the road."
              - "Just know we have just met so, I can't fully trust you."
    - hg[Option 3]: Hey, aren't you similar to that ice wolf in those caverns?
      - "???" 
      - "Why do I feel like I know him, but also not..?"
      - "Anyways.. looks like you guys got stuck there huh?"
        - hg[Yup.]
          - "I might be able to help. Just know though that we are just acquaintances."

  ###[Acquaintances (0 Trust) (Intro)]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "Again?"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "..well this is awkward."
  - hg[Variant 3]: "Got stranded again?"
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Well dang, didn't expect you here again [Player]." <13px>((IF you are friends with Noobbiom.))
    - hg[Yup.]
      - "Alright, let's cut to the chase- I'll fix the bus. Get, set, go!"

  ###[Acquaintances (0 Trust) (While Helping)]
  - hg[Variant 1]: "This bus should've collapsed by now... what kind of material were they using- Oh uh, hey!"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "Hm.. I don't think I can comprehend what any of these components are but... uh, hey there!"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "I could've sworn a friend of mine have sent me a manual to work with these busses.. Ironic how it's come to use..." 
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Got anything you need?"
  - hg[Variant 5]: "Oh, hey there [Player]! Just.. wait a moment-! There we go, anyways you doing alright?" <13px>((If you are friends with Noobbiom.))
  - hg[Variant 6]: "wow this bus sucks" <13px>((If today is Monday.))
  - hg[Variant 7]: "I could go for some smores.. the store nearby doesn't have them though.. augh..." <13px>((If today is Tuesday))
  - hg[Variant 8]: "efeuc, I have The Sludge and will give it to you in 5 seconds. **You will not survive.**" <13px>((Rare, only happens if you are efeuc.))
    - efeuc then dies.
    - hg[Option 1]: You need some help there?
      - "Maybe.. I don't think you know much about how this bus works... It's all.. weird quantum components and stuff."
        - hg[Option 1]: Quantum components?
          - "Well, I've had my experience in these busses, and I've only been able to grasp on what they do.."
            - hg[Option 1]: Can't be *that* hard!
              - "Well then, explain this!"
              - *You*: You look into the panel that Fang is working on.. 
              - *You*: It suddenly fills you with immense confusion.
                - hg[???]
                  - "Yeah.. not sure how one can do this without much experience.. and I'm not a mechanic either..."
            - hg[Option 2]: You've been to this bus before?
              - "Not specifically this bus, but I have been plenty of times."
              - "Weird thing is, I can't seem to remember how I even escaped it. I just woke up in the forest one day."
              - "Still plannin' on going back to the city though, well if I even find a way back."
                - Following this dialogue will allow you to offer the [Compass](compass) to him.
        - hg[Option 2]: Anything I can do to help?
          - "Not much unfortunately.. best you can do though is not get lost in the forest like I did."
    - hg[Option 2]: Anything about your past?
      - "Don't feel like opening much, but I can share a few things or more."
       - hg[Option 1]: About yourself...
         - "Well, I wasn't really much of a cityfolk, or even any at all. But I've wanted to know what it's like to be in those shimmering lights every night."
         - "Unfortunately, those lights are no longer around here. So I'm not familiar with this area."
           - hg[You could perhaps join us.]
             - "Definitely inviting, but no thanks. I feel a bad omen going back to that bus everytime."
             - "Maybe if I had something to help me navigate through this forest, then that would be very appreciated.."
               - Following this dialogue will allow you to offer the [Compass](compass) to him.
       - hg[Option 2]: Any friends perhaps?
          - "Ah, I have a lot of friends, particularly those back in those cities. I think you might've seen them once or twice before!"
            - hg[You seem pretty excited.]
              - "Heh, yeah. Can't help it though as they always bring a smile to my face thinking about them.."
              - "Well, I'll find my way back to them eventually."
    - hg[Option 3]: You need anything?
      - "Not much actually, I have managed to bring some food and water.. but nothing that would help me get back..."
        - hg[Navigation tools, perhaps?] <13px>((Accessible once you've unlocked the offer.))
          - "Dead right you are! I uhm... don't seem to have any though." 
          - "I could *try* following the day and moon, but they seem to go anywhere at this point."
            - hg[Offer item: Compass]
              - "A.. compass? That's something that I needed! Well.. not like I'll find anything familar but.. thank you!"
              - *You: Looks like that compass finally had some use. +1 trust*
      
  ###[Acquaintances (0 Trust) (After Helping)]
    - "Alright, I fixed it enough to where you should find a mechanic before my repairs break down."
    - "Be on your way."
