  ##[Info]
  Steven_Scripts is an NPC that appears in Bus Simulator in both Bloxdonalds and Steven Ride, he is also a developer of the game.

  ##[Appearance]
  He appears to have a Blue-Black stripped jacket over a Lua shirt, a harmonica, 4 hearts at the left of his head, a ROBLOX cap, 150K Summer Shades, and Jeans.

  ##[Favourite Drink]
  Steven's favourite drink is [Mango Juice](cafe-coffee/recipes). This gives you either 6 Passenger Rep or Driver Rep.

  ##[Dialogue (Bloxdonalds)]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"stevenemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/steven.json"

  - "Uh, hey."
    - hg[Option 1]: What are you doing back here?
    - hg[Option 2]: [Leave quietly.]
        - "I'm just trying to eat lunch."
            - hg[Option 1]: Why is there a body behind you?
                - "Body? What body?"
            - hg[Option 2]: Oookay... [Leave.] 

  ##[Trivia]
  - Compared to the many other talkative NPCs in the game, Steven_Scripts cannot be annoyed using an [Airhorn](airhorn).
    - Steven also has no new dialogue regardless if you are friends with them, similar to [Tazer](tazer) and other NPCs.
    - Depending on Steven's location in Steven Ride, you might also accidentally trigger [Pear](pear).
  - If Steven_Scripts in Steven Ride fails to exit the Bus before the [Backwalls](backwalls) event happens, he can be spotted in the walls / corners of a room, violently sobbing.\n\n
  - If the Steven Ride event is trigged while Steven is already on the bus, it will result in encountering what seems to be a humanoid shaped stone in front of the bus instead of Steven. It then gets run over by the bus and collapses, ending the event.\n\n
  - While you may not be able to see Steven_Scripts at first glance during his introduction, the harmonica sound effect will still play before and after the introduction.\n\n
    - The harmonica sound effect is also be distorted if you spot him in the [Backwalls](backwalls).
  - If Steven_Scripts ride on the Bus and all of the seats on the first floor are filled, Steven_Scripts will instead sit down next to the bathroom, defeated.
