  ##[Info]
  Stanley is an NPC in Bus Simulator found within the crashed bus on the [Cafe](cafe) map. He is an OC that MediumKey made.

  ##[Appearance]
  Stanley wears the BloxDonalds outfit that you can buy on the Marketplace and wears a cap to pair with it. He also has bagged eyes.

  ##[Dialogue]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"stanleyemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/stanley.json"
  - "Uh, hey."
    - hg[Option 1]: What are you doing back here?
    - hg[Option 2]: [Leave quietly.]
        - "I'm just trying to eat lunch."
            - hg[Option 1]: Why is there a body behind you?
                - "Body? What body?"
            - hg[Option 2]: Oookay... [Leave.] 
    - hg[Option 3]: Wait, weren't you just on the bus?
      - "I dunno :3"
        - hg[Option 1]: Okay...
        - hg[Option 2]: What?
          - "What?"
      
  ##[Trivia]
  - Based off of the dialogue, it's very probable that Stanley arrived as a result of aggrovating [MLG](mlg), as described as having blue skin and changing through realities.
  - The BloxDonalds that Stanley is involved in is drastically better compared to the current [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds).
