            - hg[Option 1]: Why is there a body behind you?
                - "Body? What body?"
            - hg[Option 2]: Oookay... [Leave.] 
    - hg[Option 3]: Wait, weren't you just on the bus?

        - hg[Option 2]: What?
          - "What?"
      
  ##[Trivia]
  - Compared to the many other talkative NPCs in the game, Steven_Scripts cannot be annoyed using an [Airhorn](airhorn).
    - Steven also has no new dialogue regardless if you are friends with them, similar to [Tazer](tazer) and other NPCs.
    - Depending on Steven's location in Steven Ride, you might also accidentally trigger [Pear](pear).
  - If Steven_Scripts in Steven Ride fails to exit the Bus before the [Backwalls](backwalls) event happens, he can be spotted in the walls / corners of a room, violently sobbing.\n\n
  - If the Steven Ride event is trigged while Steven is already on the bus, it will result in encountering what seems to be a humanoid shaped stone in front of the bus instead of Steven. It then gets run over by the bus and collapses, ending the event.\n\n
  - While you may not be able to see Steven_Scripts at first glance during his introduction, the harmonica sound effect will still play before and after the introduction.\n\n
    - The harmonica sound effect is also be distorted if you spot him in the [Backwalls](backwalls).
  - If Steven_Scripts ride on the Bus and all of the seats on the first floor are filled, Steven_Scripts will instead sit down next to the bathroom, defeated.
  - Steven used to work at [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds) at one point, but had moved away as evidenced with the Bulletin Board within the [Backwalls version of BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls).
