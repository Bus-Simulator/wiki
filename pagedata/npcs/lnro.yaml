  - "Oh-! I'll be there in a bit, please wait patiently up front!"
    - hg[Option 1]: Have you seen a mechanic around here?
      - "Seen a mechanic? I *am* a mechanic."
      - "I'm gonna be busy with the cafe all day though. None of my employees came in today, so it's just me..."
        - hg[Option 1]: I can fill in.
          - "Oh! That'd be really helpful, actually."
          - "How about this: you take care of the customers, serve them and make their drinks, and I'll go out and fix your bus. Deal?"
            - hg[Option 1]: Actually...
              - "Oh, no, don't worry, I understand. You're the customer... I shouldn't have you doing my job."
            - hg[Option 2]: Deal.
              - "Okay, awesome." (first visit..? -Nyx)
              - "I'll get to it then, so you should to!" (not enough info given. -Nyx)
        - hg[Option 1]: Unfortunate!
    - hg[Option 2]: Okay.
  
  ###[When the bus has been parked for too long]
  - "That bus has been out there for a while now..." <small>(This is said on the Roblox Chat)</small>
  - "Hey um, can you move? You're taking up all of the parking space.. I don't think my customers can get in like this."
  - You: "We can't"
  - "What? Is that bus broken down..?"
  - "*sigh*... I guess i can fix it for you. But you're gonna have to leave once I'm done. <10px>(hg[I'm already being stretched thin as-is..])"
    - After a while
      - "It's all fixed up now. Be on your way."
