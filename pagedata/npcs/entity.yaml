  ##[Info]
  Entities are NPC's found in the [Backwalls](backwalls), they're hostile towards players and will kill them if exposed enough.

  ##[AI (Artificial Intellegence)]
  - The AI of the entities works like the NPCs found in [No Dough](no-dough) and [Santa's Gone](santas-gone) except a few major differences.
  - If they spot a player in the Backwalls they will check the area where they last spotted them.
  - They don't get distracted to any items (Example Airhorn, Spronkbib Popsicle, etc) making them nearly useless.
  - Their speed increases when they fully spotted a player.
  - Sometimes, Entities can bundle up in an area, making it harder/impossible to pass through without [Liquid Void](liquid-void).
  - If you get spotted, you will be stunned for a second, much like getting spotted in No Dough. But you don't die immediately.
