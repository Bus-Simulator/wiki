  "The entities around here are kinda scary... I tried to hide away in a room when one spotted me, but it still knew where I was..! I guess they can still track you for a bit when you're out of sight..." -"Pear"

  ##[Info]
  Entities are NPCs found in the [Backwalls](backwalls), they're hostile towards players and will kill them if they directly contact the player. They also have a faint unnatural sound and cannot attack [Pear](pear).
  \n 
  ##[Appearance]
  The entities are both tall and slim, with a very unnatural material composition. They possess only white eyes and have a dark aura around them. 
  \n 
  ##[Tips]
  Much like the Civilians from [No Dough](no-dough) and [Santa's Gone](santas-gone), they can detect players within their range, but with a few alterations.
  - Entities can detect players in a much wider range and remembers your position if the line of sight breaks, they are also generally faster and undistractable by sound items. 
  - Once they detect you, you won't instantly die but get stunned. Only a well timed [Almond Water](almond-water) and [Liquid Void](liquid-void) can save you in this case. 
    - You may also try to use the teleporters if you are near one or the exit, but there's no guarantee it's a risk worth taking.
  - You may also use Liquid Void to evade them completely or by timing your movements right.
