  ##[Info]
  D6 is an NPC in the [GOATed Gas Station](goated-gas-station) event, as well as an artist.

  ##[Appearance]
  As of July 20th 2023, D6's design has been changed to one more complex, now having a long black hair with what seems to be horns poking out of it,
  along with a maroon punk jacket, suspenders and pauldrons.
  \n\n
  His face appears to be complely obscured by shadow, with only one of their eyes visible.
  \n\n
  Before this, D6 had a more simple design, with black arms and legs, yellow torso, and a white head. He wore White Oni Horns, Outrageous Builders Club Hard Hat,
  a White Kobold snout and frills, white fur, a White Lizard Tail, and the Hexxed symbol on his chest.

  ##[Favourite Drink]
  D6's favourite drink is [The Sludge](cafe-coffee/recipes). This gives you either 4 Passenger Rep or 4 Driver Rep.

                  - "im d6"
                      - You've made that clear, yes.
                          - " "
                              - (The player then explodes.)

                  - "sometimes i feel the sudden urge to break into someone's house and talk about turtle skeletons from a specific video game franchise for hours."
                      - ...That sounds oddly specific.
                          - "say hi to zeon for me"
              - hg[Variant 7]:
                  - "Do not let it affect you in the moment. It is all ultimately meaningless. The passage of time spares none, has spared none, and will spare none. You are no exception."
                      - The rides:
              - hg[Variant 8]:
                  - "i think i could beat that cat on the bus in a fist fight"
                      - That's mean.

                      - hg[Option 1]: Sure.
                          - (The player hands D6 a random consumable item.)
                              - "thanks"
                      - hg[Option 2]: I'd... rather not.
                          - "please ill give you this handy dandy Tool"
                              - hg[Option 1]: Deal.
                                  - "pleasure doing business"
                                      - (The player hands D6 a random consumable item and receives a [Tool](tool).)
                              - hg[Option 2]: No deal.
                                  - "You think this is a game? Do you find this amusing?"
                                      - Kind of.
              - hg[Variant 11]:
                  - "i am sincerely sorry for your loss"
                      - Sorry
              - hg[Variant 12]:
                  - "my brain hurts"
                      - Ok.
              - hg[Variant 13]:
                  - "END OF DIALOGUE"

  ###[Airhorn-Related "Dialogue"]
  If the airhorn is used repeatedly in close proximity to D6:
  - The player automatically unequips the airhorn.

  ##[Trivia]
  - D6 is second to having the most amount of dialogue lines, only being behind by Pear by 34 lines or more.
    - Despite this though, he has the most amount of variants a character can have, and likely the most amount of dialogue bytes in the game.
  -  His lines make plenty of references to memes, his own personal interest, or general media.
     - ["man i could really go for some graham crackers right about now"](https://twitter.com/GandalfGetsTo) is a reference to a TikTok account where a cat owner lets their cat, named Gandalf, gets to lick a Graham Cracker every Monday.
     - ["i cant believe i had to drive all the way to work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-LTE6vIb9U&ab_channel=HigherQualityUploads) is a reference to a line from Toy Story 2, where Al has to drive across the street to his job on a Saturday.
     - "dude... GLAGGLELAND??????" is a reference to a bunch of videos about Glaggleland, a fictional amusement park filled with smileys and silliness.
     - "...and talk about turtle skeletons from a specific video game franchise for hours." is a reference to [Dry Bones](https://www.mariowiki.com/Dry_Bones) from the Super Mario franchise, that both D6 and [Zeon](zeom) indeed like talking about.
     - "7577234764 Dont forget it. It's the only way out.". 7577234764 is actually a Roblox marketplace ID for an image of a paper D6 that dSiiiiiix has.
  - When Bus Simulator got age restricted for 14+ for the first time, the reasoning as to why it was restricted was because D6's "why havent you been flattened by a 2 ton slab of concrete" was more than enough for the game to receive a Violence tag.
      - This was appealed however, but it wasn't the last time Bus Simulator had been age-restricted before.
  - D6 is the only NPC to respond when the player spams the [Airhorn](airhorn), but without talking once.
