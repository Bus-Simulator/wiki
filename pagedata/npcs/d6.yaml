  ##[Info]
  D6 is an NPC in both the [GOATed Gas Station](goat-station) event and the [Cafe](cafe) event, as well as an artist.

  ##[Appearance]
  D6 is a grey toned hyena, with a bandana, belt with a large pocket, and a bandolier with ammunition.
  \n\n
  Previously, they used to be a presumable humanoid entity with long black hair that has two horn-like strands curving upwards.
  They used to wear a black T-shirt with long black gloves, a black scarf, dark gray cargo pants, and flannel tied around their waist.
  \n\n
  Thair face appears to be completely obscured by shadow, with only one of their eyes visible.
  \n\n
  And when they were first introduced, D6 had a more simple design, with black arms and legs, yellow torso, and a white head. They wore White Oni Horns, Outrageous Builders Club Hard Hat,
  a White Kobold snout and frills, white fur, a White Lizard Tail, and the sigil of Lucifer on their chest.

  ##[Favourite Drink]
  D6's favourite drink is [The Sludge](cafe-coffee-recipes). This gives you either 4 Passenger Rep or 4 Driver Rep.

                                  - "they can't talk"
                      - hg[Option 2]: Dang.
              - hg[Variant 16]: (If you already talked to d6 about the joke book, this will replace it instead. The options and dialogue are the same.)
                  - "im still trying to make sense of the pages"

  ###[Airhorn Responses (Goat Station)]
  If the airhorn is used repeatedly in close proximity to D6:

                                - "hi"
            - hg[Option 4]: Why the cans?
                - "i REALLY love bloxy cola dude" (The word "REALLY" uses effects that makes it incomprehensible.)

                - "i might be addicted"

  ###[Drink Responses (Goat Station & Cafe)]
  - If you give D6 the wrong drink:
    - "..."
    - "RIDICOLOUS FOLLY. INEXCUSABLE."
    - "I CANNOT CONSUME THIS FOUL SUBSTANCE YOU PEANUT BRAINED FOOL."
    - "go give it to disc or something im sure he'll drink it"
    - "hah. goats."
        - hg[My bad.]
  - If you give D6 <clr:#151812>(***The Sludge.***):
    - "..."
    - "splendid."
    - "this is almost as good as bloxy cola"
        - hg[You're welcome.]
            - This dialogue repeats even with another favorite drink.

  ##[Trivia]
  - D6 is second to having the most amount of dialogue lines, only being behind by Pear by 34 lines or more.
    - Despite this though, he has the most amount of variants a character can have, and likely the most amount of dialogue bytes in the game.
  - His lines make plenty of references to memes, his own personal interest, or general media.
    - ["man i could really go for some graham crackers right about now"](https://twitter.com/GandalfGetsTo) is a reference to a TikTok account where a cat owner lets their cat, named Gandalf, gets to lick a Graham Cracker every Monday.
    - ["i cant believe i had to drive all the way to work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-LTE6vIb9U&ab_channel=HigherQualityUploads) is a reference to a line from Toy Story 2, where Al has to drive across the street to his job on a Saturday.
    - "dude... GLAGGLELAND??????" is a reference to a bunch of videos about Glaggleland, a fictional amusement park filled with smileys and silliness.
    - "...and talk about turtle skeletons from a specific video game franchise for hours." is a reference to [Dry Bones](https://www.mariowiki.com/Dry_Bones) from the Super Mario franchise, that both D6 and [Zeon](zeom) indeed like talking about.
    - "7577234764 Dont forget it. It's the only way out.". 7577234764 is actually a Roblox marketplace ID for an image of a paper D6 that dSiiiiiix has.
    - ["would you like to sign my petition?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JoJUkIhEjs) is a reference to Postal 2, wherein on Tuesday, the Postal Dude is tasked with collecting signaures for a petition to 'make whiney congressmen play violent video games'.
  - When Bus Simulator got age restricted for 14+ for the first time, the reasoning as to why it was restricted was because D6's "why havent you been flattened by a 2 ton slab of concrete" was more than enough for the game to receive a Violence tag.
    - This was appealed however, but it wasn't the last time Bus Simulator had been age-restricted before.
  - D6 is the only NPC to respond when the player spams the [Airhorn](airhorn), but without talking once.
  - Based off of the dialogue for where he originated from, the hints provided alongside the ['weird gray feline'](pear) allude to his origin place being the [Backwalls](backwalls).
