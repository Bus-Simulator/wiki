          - "Yeah, yeah. I'm guessing you're here for the burger, so, take it. ssiiigggghhhhh... I don't get paid enough for this."
              - The player receives the [Burger](/bussim/items/burger).
          - "Hey. I said one per customer. I can see you're hiding that burger in your pocket. Don't try..."

              - hg[Option 2]: Are you okay..?
                  - "I am severely underpaid, and we are incredibly short-staffed. We don't even get any applications, because nobody knows where we are. I have to do all the work myself, and my manager is sooooo cheap that we don't even have a kitchen. Do you think I'm okay?"
                      - I mean, I'm here..
                          - "Well, I'm not the manager, so."
              - hg[Option 3]: Wait, if there's no kitchen, then where..?
                  - "Don't ask questions you aren't prepared for the answers to."
                      - hg[Option 1]: Sheesh, sorry..
                      - hg[Option 2]: Nevermind.
