  ##[Dialogue (GOATed Gas Station)]
  !!DLEMULATOR EID:"goat_mlgemulator" SID:"start" URL:"/assets/bussim/emulatorData/mlg.json"

  - "Hey, what are you doing here? Did we leave the door open?"
    - hg[Option 1]: Hi! I'm here to take your stuff.
        - "Don't, or I'll make sure you never steal anything again."
            - hg[Option 1]: Sheesh, alright.
                - "Good."
            - hg[Option 2]: Don't care.
                - "Don't."
                    - hg[Option 1]: WOAH, okay! Fine! I won't!
                        - "Good."
                    - hg[Option 2]: I'm not scared of you.
                        - (The Player Dies)
    - hg[Option 2]: Bye.
    - hg[Option 3]: Who are you?
        - "Oh, uh, my name is MLG. It's short for MLGBudderCD. I'm only here because of how dirt cheap the rent is around here."
            - hg[Option 1]: Tell me more.
                - "Ok sure, I play video games a lot and spend a lot of time trying to survive in this place. Living off of gas station food really does a number to the body, but I still manage."
                    - hg[Option 1]: Do you have any friends?
                        - "A wee bit hurtful that you would need to ask, but yes, I do have friends. In and out of this town. Green, D6, Zeon, and Tazer are a handful of them that live here. Noble's another one, but I don't see him in town often. Now go away, I've had enough socializing about myself for now."
                    - hg[Option 2]: Neat, bye.
            - hg[Option 2]: 'Kay, bye.

  ##[Trivia]
  - MLG is one of the few NPCs that won't instantly kill you when annoyed, but gets real close to doing so.
  - MLG used to work at [BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds) at one point, but had moved away as evidenced with the Bulletin Board within the [Backwalls version of BloxDonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls).
