  ##[Info]
  The Civilians are minor NPCs that appear in two events, [No Dough](/bussim/events/no-dough), [Passengers](/bussim/events/passengers), and [Cafe](/bussim/events/cafe), 
  and have no dialogue or do anything important in the game (excluding the Cafe event).

  ##[Appearance]
  Their appearance is random, as they are based off of player IDs, which means that
  NPCs' appearance is based off of what player the script chose to wear, which is commonly the 3.0 Man Default with the Smile face.
  \n\n
  However, there are also IDs for NobleReign's friends that has a higher, but still rare, chance of appearing in the events,
  which do also include some NPCs from events, like the NPCs from [GOATed Gas Station](/bussim/events/goated-gas-station) event.

  ##[Actions]
  The Civilians don't do much in events, but is still notable in some way,
  mostly in the [No Dough](/bussim/events/no-dough) event where Civilians act as security.

  ###[Passengers]
  In the Passengers event, three random Civilians from a Bus Stop will board the bus and take the nearest available seat,
  and will ride the bus for a random amount of time. After some time, the Civilians will get off the seat, wave for a couple of seconds,
  then jump off the bus.
  \n\n
  They don't say anything when they're boarding or jumping off the bus. Unlike [Steven](/bussim/npcs/steven) from his event, [Steven Ride](/bussim/events/steven-ride)

  ###[No Dough / Santa's Gone]
  In the No Dough event, the Civilians act more like security, and will kill you instantly if you're spotted long enough.
  \n\n
  They will also get alerted based off of noise (for more information, refer to it's [event](/bussim/events/no-dough) page), and will go towards the noise if alerted.
  \n\n
  This is great for clearing out an crowded area, but a risky move getting away from the oncoming crowd of Civilians.

  ###[Cafe]
  Civilians will come into randomly generated outfits, ask for a drink (if the player chooses the correct option), and will sit down at any available
  seat, awaiting for their drink. The civilian leaves if they recieve the correct/incorrect drink, or if they haven't been served and time has ran out.

  ##[Trivia]
  - If there are no open seats, the Civilians will stand in the back of the bus, near the restroom.
