  - hg[Variant 1]: "Beep boop?"
  - hg[Variant 2]: "zzzzz.... Wha?... Oh, what's up?"
  - hg[Variant 3]: "Can you believe the prices of gas these days? It cost me 55 passenger rep just to fill up the gas tank on my Mini Bus!"
  - hg[Variant 4]: "Am I finally out of detention? Oh, you're not the principal. What do you want?"
      - hg[Option 1]: Do you know about the gas station over there?
          - "Oh, that place? Don't know much about it, but I drove my Mini-Bus around in there a few days ago and got kicked out. They said something like.."
          - [Disc](/bussim/npcs/disc): "Stop driving your Mini-Bus around in places it's not supposed to be in!"
          - [Green](/bussim/npcs/green): "I swear to God, I'm gonna lose it if I have to clean up your skid marks again! You gotta go!"
          - "But driving is fun..!"
      - hg[Option 2]: How long have you been here for?
          - "I don't know, like, probably a few hours. I think..."
      - hg[Option 3]: What are you doing here?
          - "I drove my Mini-Bus inside the school, and one of the teachers caught me and confiscated it."
      - hg[Option 4]: Let's Talk!
          - hg[Variant 1]: "If you really want to."
          - hg[Variant 2]: "Well, uh. Not really sure what to talk about, but i suppose we could chat."
              - hg[Variant 1]: "I've been researching a lot about unusual places lately. Apparently, there's this place called 'The Backwalls'. Not sure if this is real, but i really want to explore around there if it is. Apparently, there's this tall shadow figure that chases you if you aren't careful, though. Hopefully they aren't too common."
              - hg[Variant 2]: "This is the most bogus way to spend my free time, honestly. The teachers here are so strict about 'No driving Mini Buses on campus!' but I never see them enfore the that rule on anyone else! It makes sense that I'm the only one who gets in trouble for it."
              - hg[Variant 3]: "I've been modifying the heck out of my Mini Bus lately. I hope the principal doesn't take it away for too long. I just got it a few days ago, and I've already started to get pretty attached to it."
                  - hg[Option 1]: Why not just sneak it out and drive away?
                      - "If I wasn't being watched by the teachers so closely, don't you think I would have already DONE that by now?"
                  - hg[Option 2]: F
              - hg[Variant 4]: "I saw some dude jumping around with some sort of rocket launcher made of cones a while ago. Not sure how it works, but if I were you, I wouldn't make them angry."
              - hg[Variant 5]: "With kind regards, from Tazer."
                  - The player then gets flung.
              - hg[Variant 6]: "I'm a bit hungry. How about if you can find a stick of RAM and bring it back to me, I can give you... How about 2 Driver Rep in return?"
                  - hg[Option 1]: There's no way you said it unironically.
                      - "Yeah, what's it to you? Do you want the rep or not?"
                          - hg[Option 1]: Sure, I guess so.
                              - "Cool. I don't know where you'd find one, though. Maybe [Zeon"(/bussim/npcs/zeon) has one?]
                          - hg[Option 2]: No.
                              - ":("
                  - hg[Option 2]: Sure.
                      - "Awesome. I don't know where you'd find some though. Maybe [Zeon"(/bussim/npcs/zeon) has a stick?]
                  - I have your RAM (Only appears if the player already has RAM)
                      - Proceeds to hg[Option 5] Variants 1 - 2
      - hg[Option 5]: I'm back, and I have your RAM. (Only appears if the player has the ram stick)
          - hg[Variant 1]: "Wait, really? Thanks! Here's that rep I promised."
          - hg[Variant 2]: "Here's your rep, now get lost! Haha just kidding! Feel free to talk to me again sometime."
              - The player then receives 2 Driver rep.
          - hg[Variant 3] (Illegal RAM): "Wait, really? Hey, wait a second.. This RAM is unmarked! Bootleg! Are you trying to scam me? Well, this'll be the last scam you'll ever pull."
              - The player then explodes
          - hg[Variant 4] (If already completed): "Uhh.. I kinda feel like I've done this before.. I don't really feel that hungry anymore.."
      - hg[Option 6]: Nevermind.
          - hg[Variant 1]: "Then stop wasting my time."
          - hg[Variant 2]: "Cya then."
          - hg[Variant 3]: "Bruh..."
          - hg[Variant 4]: "With regards from Tazer..."
              - The player is then flung
          - hg[Variant 5]: "Tazer jumpscare"
              - Tazer then kills the player by "jumpscaring" them.
  
  ###[Airhorn-Related Dialogue]
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Tazer
    - "It's already hard enough being in detention, can you not?"
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Tazer for a second time
    - ""No, like actually stop it. I'm not even allowed to leave the room."
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Tazer for a third time
    - "And I thought I was obnoxious..."
  - If the airhorn is used repeatedly in proximity to Tazer for a fourth time and so on
    - "With regards from Tazer."
      - The player then gets flung
  
  ##[Trivia]
  - When you visit GoatedGas, you're able to find a discarded note in the trash can, inspecting it gives you what is written on the note:
    - To Disc & Green, I am highly unsatisfied with the way your services has been. Not only have you applied spike strips to the door, thus popping the tires on my Mini-Bus, and charged me for spare tires, but you have also charged me double on gas when refueling my Mini-Bus due to "being too reckless." I find it extremely unfair that you guys are punishing me this way, and I request that you drop the doubled charges at once. I cannot afford to use 55 passenger rep on one refuel. - Signed, Tazer
  -Tazer is the only person to have a custom reskin of the Mini-Bus, being a Race Car.
    - You can also find and use the same skin in [Minibus Racing](https://www.roblox.com/games/5556164542/Minibus-Racing-Very-Early-Pre-Alpha) by purchasing it in the shop, as well as in Kit Battle, as a cosmetic for him.
  - It is entirely possible to get the Illegal RAM dialogue without assistance of an Admin by double-clicking Tazer to where he has two versions of himself, and swiftly double-clicking the RAM option.\n\n
  - Tazer, [D6](/bussim/npcs/d6), and [MLG](/bussim/npcs/mlg) are fully capable of killing the player by their normal dialogue options, however doesn't actually kill them when annoyed via an Airhorn, compared to other more passive NPCs like [Frostbite](/bussim/npcs/frostbite).
