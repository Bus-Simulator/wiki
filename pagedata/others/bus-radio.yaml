  ##[Info]
  The Radio is a functional prop in The Bus in Bus Simulator. It plays a large variety of songs and intermissions around the bus, and can be listened to via Airpods. 
  \n\n
  On display you'll be able to see the player who queued the song as well as what song in particular that's being played.
  \n 
  You can also either bass boost the next song in queue, or replace the next default song in queue with a manually selected song using the audio ID or by searching it up. 
  \n\n
  Intermissions also appear at most every 5 songs, manually queued or not and cannot be replaced by queued songs. It also often appears whenever the server starts. 
  \n\n
  There's also a couple of minor details such as the radio having a visualizer as well as having the in-game time more accurate compared to the Phone. 
  \n\n 
  The visualizer also comes in two different styles, being both found in Performance Settings and be disabled as an option. It goes as follows: 
  - Classic - Uses the old radio visualizer where hard beats often light up the screen from the bottom.
  - Spectrum - Uses a new radio visualizer made by Roblox and completely visualizes the music being played. Automatically turns on at graphics level 8+ by default. 
    - If the song has no audio, it'll instead do an ocean's wave.
  - Off - Completely disables the visualizer.
  \n\n
  You can also search up using either the name of the song, or with advanced filters like song length, authors, etc, with the maximum song length being 15 minutes, consuming a single song that you have **(with the exception being Private Servers)**. 
  \n\n 
  You can get more songs by: 
  - Buying the Bus Driver gamepass and joining every day.
  - Receive it as special rewards during an event like New Years or on other happy occassions.
  - Receive it when someone buys 2 free songs for everyone, including themselves via Pear.
  - Purchase a single song yourself for only 10 R$, if you don't have any free songs.
  \n\n 
  Currently there is no way to change the radio channel, as it is locked in 295.2 or MEME RADIO, hosted by Teddy, Tazer, Mineboom, MLGBudderCD, Pear, Starfall, Green, and Pixel_Neko. *(not to be confused by their NPC versions!)*
  \n\n
  ##[Tracks]
  The total amount of tracks that has been documented thus far is currently **137+, with 123 being Normal, 6 being Halloween, and 8 being Christmas**. please add in case you find a new track, thank you! 
  \n\n 
  Also most audio IDs that are present may not work following March 22nd of 2022, but those that do work will be bolded, mainly Monstercat tracks. 
  \n\n 
  **(Has to be a natural song, check if it's MEME RADIO or anyone as long as the player that submitted it isn't in the server.)**
  \n\n 
  ##[Normal / All Season Tracks]
  These tracks are playable throughout the entire year, anytime, anyday.
