  ##[Info]
  The Television, or TV for short, is an interactive prop that appears both in [The Bus](the-vus) and [Noble's House](nobles-house). 
  \n\n
  The TV has 12* channels, with some of which, e.g. the donation leaderboard, being dynamic. There are remotes in the previously mentioned places, with the Blue Button incrementing the channel, and the Red Button turning the TV off or on. If the channel goes past 12, it'll loop back to 1. 
  \n\n
  *If [Pear Takes The Wheel](pear-takes-the-wheel) is active, it'll instead go to CH ðŸ˜º, being the 13th channel, after his event ends; it'll change back to what the channel previously was before his takeover. 
  \n\n 
  The TV in The Bus can only be changed if you are currently in the driver's seat.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Even though The Bus's TV has 13 channels, the one in Noble's House is still stuck at 9.
  - map_Thanksgiving is actually featured, and debuted first, in Kit Battle before being added as a TV station.
  - There were originally a few channels that were introduced in the older builds of Bus Simulator but are now removed from the game. These channels are purely kept for archival, these being:
  | Channel ID | Name | Description | Image |
  |------------|------|-------------|-------|
  | 0 | Murder TV | Shows a variety of old memes, being Snoop Dog, Nyan Cat, and Hypnofrog. This was prior to the remote and the other channels and has been removed following the additions.| ![138x69](/bussim-assets/images/others/tv/murdertv.webp) |
  | 5 | Petting | Shows a gif of a human touching a black wolf's ears, with water ambience and various noises in the background. This was removed due to controversy related to the media behind it.| ![138x69](/bussim-assets/images/others/tv/petting.webp) |
