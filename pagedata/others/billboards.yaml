  ##[Info]
  The billboards are props that appear within the vast majority of biomes, often showcasing real advertisements from companies and sometimes crossovers, examples are Nike, H&M, and Metallica x Piggy.
  \n\n
  If there are no advertisements shown, it'll use one of Bus Simulator's community-made advertisements, very much being jokes and references, with some advertising NobleReign's various games outside of Bus Simulator.
  \n\n
  They can also only be seen by those whose accounts are over the age of 13, those below are unable to see any.

  ##[Community Advertisements]
  Here's all of the images of all of the community-made advertisements. These advertisements shows up when there is no
  available Roblox ADs to show on the billboard.
