  ##[Info]
  Commands are a feature in Bus Simulator used to change small elements of the game, such as chat tag customisation and private server commands.
  \n\n
  Most commands use the ! prefix, excluding the default emote command, which requires /e instead. This page will list all of the commands you can do both in public and private servers.

  ##[Commands]
  ###[All Servers - Emotes]
  Emotes can be used in all servers and are mostly meant for fun, some emotes like /e smug have special effects only visible with certain settings, and others like /e honda can be used while walking. The following are all of the emotes you can currently do.
