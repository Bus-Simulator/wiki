  ##[Info]
  Edit is an item that cannot be obtained via events or from the bus/gamepass, as only VIP server owners and admins can obtain it, and give it to other people.
  \n\n
  Similar to Btools, Edit allows you to build stuff with the F3X builder tool. The blueprints also change in color, based on what you're using (i.e. Yellow - Move, Black - New Part, etc.).
  \n\n 
  If you want to give somebody Edit in your VIP server (Server Owner required), you just would say "!btools (Username. Can be partial)".
