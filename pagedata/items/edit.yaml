  ##[Info]
  Edit is an item that cannot be obtained via events or from the bus/gamepass, as only VIP server owners and admins can obtain it, and give it to other people.
  \n\n
  Similar to Btools, Edit allows you to build stuff with the F3X builder tool. The blueprints also change in color, based on what you're using (i.e. Yellow - Move, Black - New Part, etc.).
  \n\n 
  If you want to give somebody Edit in your VIP server (Server Owner required), you just would say "!btools (Username. Can be partial)".
  ##[Keybinds]
  Here are the list of keybinds you can also use to maximize its potential:
  \n\n
  |Keybinds|Effects|
  |--------|-------|
  |Alt (Hold)|Allows you to select any children part within a model. Doesn't go in multiple models at once.|
  |Shift (Hold)|Allows you to manually select parts, can also be paired with Alt and is effective at mass adjustments.
  |Shift + Z (Same Time)|Undos your last action if possible.|
  |Shift + Y (Same Time)|Redos your last action if possible.|
  |Shift + X (Same Time)|Deletes your selected part, also deletes any part inside your selected part such as models.|
  |Shift + P (Same Time)|"Exports" your selection, but is banned in Bus Simulator. Use !save [1-5] instead!|
  |Shift + C (Same Time)|Clones your selected part.|
  |Shift + T (Toggle)|Allows you to select between Parts Only (Selects parts irregardless if it is within a model) or Group and Parts (Selects parts if it's not within a model, otherwise selects the model). The default is Groups and Parts.|
  |Shift + G|Groups any selected part into one model. Effective for mass selection.|
  |Shift + F (Same Time)|Groups any selected part into a folder. Allows mass selection as well.|
  |Shift + U|Ungroups any selected model or folder into parts. Especially effective for making event parts persist beyond its time or to pluck out parts fast.|
  |Shift + H|Opens up the explorer, allowing you to manually select parts regardless of visibility or hitbox. May also contain some hidden knowledge within!|
  |Alt + F|Allows you to go deeper, allowing you to select parts from a model within a model. This can repeat infinitely until there are no more children models left.|
