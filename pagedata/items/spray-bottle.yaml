  ##[Info]
  The Spray Bottle is an Admin-Exclusive item that is capable of blurring other players' screens for a while, with each subsequent use increasing the blurring.
  \n\n 
  Each spray inflicted reaches up to 16 studs and is 7 studs wide, and anyone who is unfortunate enough to be caught in it will have their screen blurred temporarily. 
  \n\n
  Those who are caught under 16 studs will have theirs blurred for a significant amount of time, whereas ones that are specifically 16 studs away will only be blinded for a couple of seconds.
  \n\n 
  Apart from that, it's a pretty harmless toy that can be a bit bothersome to the eyes, but not so much to the ears with the [Airhorn](airhorn).
