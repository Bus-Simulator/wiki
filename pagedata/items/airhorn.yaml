  ##[Info]
  The Airhorn is an expensive gamepass item in Bus Simulator, costing a huge 275 Robux. When used it produces a loud sound from where the player used it. It also has no cooldown per use.
  \n\n
  Despite its original use being to annoy players, you can use it in No Dough / Santa's Gone to distract the NPCs, luring them into the origin of sound which makes this useful if a bunch of NPCs are patrolling the exit / destination.
  \n\n
  You can also use it next to other NPCs to annoy them, but beware, for they may not be kind.

  ##[Trivia]
  - It uses the Airhorn sound used for meme culture.
  - It also made its appearance in Kit Battle's Meme Boi Kit, where you can use the Airhorn to knockback players in a large range.
  - While you can distract the house guests in [No Dough](no-dough) / [Santa's Gone](santas-gone), you can't use it in the [Backwalls](backwalls) to distract the [Entities](entity).
  - Despite it producing a loud sound, it can't echo in the caves, the bus, nor in the Backwalls.
  - This is the only gamepass item that has a badge locked behind it, being the [DEFENSTRATED badge](https://www.roblox.com/badges/2141806851/DEFENESTRATED), whereas all other badges are limited / obtainable freely. (Except Private Bus Owner, where you will need a private server.)
