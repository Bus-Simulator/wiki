  ##[Info]
  The Expired Taco is a gear obtained from the [Time Travel Event](/bussim/events/time-travel), and is obtained at the "fizzy taco stand!!!!!!." 
  \n\n 
  The taco appears to have a green tint, and deals 75 damage to the player. Much more dangerous than the [Burger](/bussim/items/burger) from the [Bloxdonalds](/bussim/events/bloxdonalds) event.
