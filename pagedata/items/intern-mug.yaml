  ##[Trivia]
  - The Twilight Daycare Veteran mug is referencing The Hunt, an official event on Roblox where it was part of the many games needed to obtain items. 
    - Likewise, due to its unfitting nature compared to other games like Combat Warriors, Fruit Battlegrounds and the like, it was one of the most mentally punishing game of all just for the idea of it.
  - The "No, this isn't how you are supposed to play the game!" is the tool-tip for the intern mug prior to its randomization.
