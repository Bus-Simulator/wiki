  ##[Info]
  The Gas Station Ice Cream is a tool obtainable by purchasing it for [8 Passenger Reputation](reputation) during the [Goat Station Event](goat-station), or by stealing it. 
  \n\n 
  The item works the same as the Ice Cream tool and other ice creams, except it plays a flangey 'Yummy' sound. It doesn't heal very well either.
