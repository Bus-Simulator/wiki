  ##[Info]
  The Map is an item that is used within the [Backwalls](backwalls) to draw out areas you have already explored and marking the escape room with a large X. 
  \n\n 
  To obtain this, you must [INFORMATION REDACTED UNTIL RELEASE] with [INFORMATION REDACTED UNTIL RELEASE] and [INFORMATION REDACTED UNTIL RELEASE]
  \n\n 
  Its appearance and function is exactly the same as the [Buried Treasure Map](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Explorer_Map), with a large cross and a player locator for whoever holds the map. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item, as well as the event and badges, was added with the 20 Million / Christmas update, but isn't a limited-time item.
  - This is a reference to an item of the same name from Terraria.
  - On September 10th, the neon mesh part of the Magic Mirror was moderated for no apparent reason, causing the item to look hollow compared the item shown in the Infobox. 
    - This has been fixed following after, with it having a similar appearance.
