  ##[Info]
  The Cola is an item that is obtainable at the Second floor, or from the [Starter Box](/bussim/items/starter-box) if you got that from the 10 Million Visits event. Using it will heal you. The cola is one of the best healing items. 
  \n\n 
  It is located inside of a crate, with several other colas. Upon clicking on it, there's a 10%(?) chance you will get the [Bad Cola](/bussim/items/bad-cola). 

  ##[Info (Backwalls)]
  "Well that was uncanny." -"Cola (Backwalls)"
  Another interaction that the Cola can provide is if paired with the [Bus Birthday Cake](/bussim/items/bus-birthday-cake) during Bus Simulator's 5th Birthday. When consumed last, you'll be forcibly teleported to the [Backwalls](/bussim/events/backwalls). With the Cola having a new tooltip, do note however that both the Cola and Cake are one-time uses afterwards.
