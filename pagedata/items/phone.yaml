  ##[Info]
  The Phone is one of the first tools in the game. It can supposedly be used as a flashlight, or just for roleplays. 
  \n\n 
  The Phone is usually kept during some events like [Backwalls](backwalls) or [No Dough](no-dough). Particles or chat bubbles will not appear through the phone due to it being glass. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - In the tooltip, the phone is actually an Android 7.1.1 Nougat.
  - As said before, the phone can be used as a mildly useful torch in dark places like the Backwalls.
  - When equipped in the Backwalls, the screen will glitch out.
