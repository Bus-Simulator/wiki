  ##[Info]
  The Phone is the first tool added in Bus Simulator and similarly is the first tool you spawn off with, recieving a full overhaul throughout the end of August 2024. It serves a multitude of functions, from being a flashlight to communicating with others privately; all with customizations to your desire.
  \n\n
  When held for the first time within a session, an arrow will pop up next to your phone, which appears next to the power button. Hold-pressing it will then boot up Nulltech, allowing you access to your phone.
  \n\n 
  The Phone is also the only item that is kept throughout all of the events within Bus Simulator, allowing you access to it anywhere you go. It can also crack, if you get hit by a moving vehicle, which can only be repaired by accessing [Pear's Place](pears-place).
  \n\n
  The general features that the phone provides are basically akin of that of normal phones. The top-left displays the time, synchronized with your real-life time and can be configured to display either in seconds or in a 24-hour format within your Settings. Swiping down from the upper edge shows you your notifications and quick-access buttons.
  \n\n 
  There will also be three buttons on the right (or left if space is unavailable) outside of the phone, going from top to bottom, the top opens your notifications, the middle sends you back home, and the bottom backs out of / or in an app.
  \n\n
  The quick-access actions, going from left to right are of the following:
  | Actions | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  |Flashlight|Allows you to turn the phone into a flashlight. It's synchronized with either your cursor or your finger when pointed outside of the screen.|
  |Airplane Mode|Enables Airplane Mode, disabling all cell reception on your phone. It also disables purchasing items within the shop, messaging, and downloading any apps.|
  |Do Not Disturb|Disables you from recieving any messages, calls, or notifications. Currently is non-functional.|
  |Battery Saver|Mainly an aesthetics function, darkens your screen.|
  |Volume Adjustment|Adjusts the volume of your system, notifications, and media.|
  You'll also be able to back out within an app by swiping to your left from the right edge, or back out into your homescreen by swiping up from the bottom edge within any app. You can also drag your phone to anywhere else within your screen by toggling on Drag Mode.
  \n\n 
  You also will start off with a few apps by default, being a Dialer, Messages, Settings, and STAR.
  ##[Home]
  Much like any phone, you can customize your home screen by adding widgets or apps allowing easy access. Over the course of your usage, you'll be able to sort and create new pages for your homescreen. You can also swipe up slightly away from the bottom edge to view all of your apps, both within and not within your home screen.
  \n\n 
  Hold-pressing on the home screen will allow you to add widgets or directly customize your wallpaper and Drag-holding the moment before the context menu (App Info, Add to Shelf & Remove) appears will allow you to move the app / widget around.
  ##[Settings]
  The Settings is where you'll be able to customize your phone, which will save after leaving. You'll be able to customize your system's theme, notification sounds, fonts, as well as your wallpaper. The wallpaper in particular, can be customized to either any of the ones provided already or to any custom decal / image, with options provided to fit for your liking. 
  \n\n 
  You can also change how time is formatted, to either being 24-hours and / or having seconds as part of the clock and what system it's currently on. The following time systems are: 
  - Operating System - Is based on your device's operating system's time, or most often than not- your real life time.
  - In-game Time - A system based within the game's own time for its day and night cycle. Moves at around 3 in-game minutes per real life second.
  - .beat - A decimal time system made to market a line of .beat watches. Divides the entire day into 1000 beats with each beat lasting 86.4 seconds in real time.
  ##[Messages]
  The Messages app allows you to privately and directly communicate with players within and outside the server. You'll also be able to respond to any inboxes, deny all incoming requests, and also block people. You can only view the history of it and are unable to send any messages while having no cell reception / signal.
  \n\n 
  To communicate with anyone privately, click the button on the bottom-right to start a conversation. From there, you can either start a conversation from anyone within the server as you, or start one outside; assuming you provide their username / User ID. Conversation data will also be saved once a conversation starts.
  \n\n
  One last extra detail is that chat bubbles are colored based on your username color on Roblox.
  ##[STAR]
  STAR, or known as Synchronized Transferable App Repository is an application store that uses coins as your balance. You'll be able to download and purchase any apps- provided with the balance that is. It also displays Today's Top Picks for both free and paid apps, and more.
  \n\n 
  Information about these apps individually are reserved in another page, except for Pear's Place.
  ##[Pear's Place]
  Pear's Place while being an app you have to download on STAR, allows you to do quests to earn <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) among other things, such as purchasing items you have already experienced or had before, downloading paid apps, and more. 
  \n\n 
  More information is within its own individual page.
  ##[Dialer]
  The dialer allows you to call others within the server, following the same block list within your Messages and on Roblox. This requires you to have Voice Chat enabled, otherwise its inoperable.

  ##[Trivia]
  - The boot-up screen of Nulltech can tell if your data has been saved and loaded properly. If there are sparkles around Nulltech when booting up, then your data was both successfully saved and loaded.
  - The time system doesn't display AM / PM within the 12-hour format.
  - The background of your avatar and your chat messages within the Messages app is directly linked with your chat color on Roblox.
  - Trying to start a conversation with yourself using the Messages app will just tell you to use Notepad for it.
  - Clicking, typing, and using the flashlight all have their own unique animations for the player.
  - The original phone, one that has been prevalent throughout the majority of Bus Simulator's life was a drastically simpler version, being a simple-handheld that allows you to activate a flashlight and also displayed the in-game time.
