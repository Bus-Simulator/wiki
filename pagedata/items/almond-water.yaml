  ##[Info]
  Almond Water is a healing item obtainable from random floor spawns in the [Backwalls](backwalls) event or bought from [Red](red) in the [Backwalls Bloxdonalds](bloxdonalds-backwalls) for [8 Passenger Reputation](reputation). When used, you will gain a significant boost in speed and healing for a few seconds, being able to outrun [Entities](entity) and move much quicker throughout the [Backwalls](backwalls), however this item only has 2 uses before it'll disappear from your inventory so use wisely.

  "Through a stroke of luck, your Almond Water has come to you into the real world.." -"Almond Water (Permanent Acquisition)"
  \n\n
  There is however, a 33% (formerly 10%) chance of permanently getting Almond Water by escaping the [Backwalls](backwalls) while you have it in your inventory. The function of the item will remain the same, and while its only usable twice, you can reset to get it back..

  ##[Trivia]
  - This item's texture was ripped from the [Backrooms Wiki](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Almond_Water).
  - The speed boost much like the other speed-related items can't be stacked by using the same item twice.
