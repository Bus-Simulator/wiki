  ##[Info]
  The 1M Cola is an item that was originally obtainable during the 1 Million Event, but is now only obtainable via Admin Commands.
  \n
  The can is purple in color, and has the party popper emoji on it, as well as the rest. The soda inside appears as a bright pink. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - There is a 1 Million Chance that something unlucky would happen because of the A One in a Millionth Mistake badge.
  - The cola doesn't make confetti when you open it, unlike the other two.
  - There is a bug with the 1M and 10M if you drink it and swap to another item, you can no longer use it.
