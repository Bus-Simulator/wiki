  | Quest | Reward | Description | Notes |
  |-------|--------|-------------|-------|
  |Win a Friday Night match against someone | <clr:#FFE669>(500 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "If you know me well enough, I'll let you play against me~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "If you see me in-game, just know that I won't back down.") | Challenging Pear counts for this quest. |
  |Sit in your seat for 3 minutes straight| <clr:#FFE669>(100 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Hope you're able to sit still!")\n\n <clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "i'm cooked....") | <0px>(.) |
  |Play the game for 15 minutes| <clr:#FFE669>(200 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "This one's a cakewalk~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Please?") | Simply just being in the game works. |
  |Chill in the Crystal Cavern for 5 minutes| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Sounds kinda familiar...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I love the acoustics there!!!" | You may need either a [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror) or an [event](glacier-cave) to do this. |
  |Get the Knife in Rock Gun Knife| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "It's like cheating, but legal!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "It's fair and balanced, right?") | The Knife appears after 4 rounds within Rock Gun Knife. |
  |Appreciate the X biome for 60 seconds| <clr:#FFE669>(200 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "A little nature goes a long way~!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I put a LOT of work into making these for you...") | Requires you to be within or on [The Bus](the-bus) while in said biome.\n\nBiome can be any within the game. |
  |Get something to eat!| <clr:#FFE669>(100 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, every day!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Hey, isn't this one really easy...?") | The quickest way to get this is by getting the [Pizza](pizza) item and eating it 10 times, if you do not have any permanent food items. | 
  |Play a full round of Connect Four| <clr:#FFE669>(250 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "It'll be fun!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I like connect four") | It doesn't matter if you win or lose, simply playing a game will count. If somebody has the [Cartridge](cartridge), try asking them for a game. |
  |Stay on the windshield for 30 seconds| <clr:#FFE669>(125 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Try not to anger the driver~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "??? THATS SO DANGEROUS???")| It would be easiest to use [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), and stand in between the windshield wipers to avoid getting wiped off. |
  |Drink five different types of soda| <clr:#FFE669>(320 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Thats a lot of soda...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Lemon-lime with REAL sugar... Bring back the Mist...") | The sodas that count are of the following:\n[- Cold Cola](cold-cola)\n[- Cola](cola)\n[- Bad Cola](bad-cola)\n[- Hot Cola](hot-cola)\n[- Cramped Cola](cramped-cola)\n[- Hyper Soda](hyper-soda)\n[- Lemon Soda](lemon-soda)\n[- Goala Cola](goala-cola)|
  |Feed Tazer a stick of RAM| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Better than whatever THIS was...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "What do you think RAM tastes like...?")| As simple as it sounds, head over to Zeon's house and into her bedroom for [RAM](ram) and then give it to [Tazer](tazer). |
  |Give D6 a Bloxy Cola during the Cafe event| <clr:#FFE669>(199 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "They can have a little cola, as a treat~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I don't understand how they like that stuff so much...")| <0px>(.) |
  |Escape the Backwalls| <clr:#FFE669>(650 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "I can always help with this one~")\n\n <clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "So liminal!!!") |  Paying Pear to escape is still elligible for this quest, although you'll only get 400 Coins if including cost. |
  |Have your color win in the Repaint Event| <clr:#FFE669>(150 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Personally, I'd go for green...")\n\n <clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "PLEAAAASE pick black, it looks so sleek!!!") | Simply select the majority vote. |
  |Play in a ball pit| <clr:#FFE669>(400 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Those are only in the Backwalls..!")\n\n <clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "YIPPEE BALL PIT") | Ballpits can be found sparsely in the Backwalls. Good luck! |
  |Stare at yourself in the mirror| <clr:#FFE669>(100 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Don't worry, you look fine!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "You.")| This one requires you to be in first person for it to count. All you need to do is zoom all the way in and look at the mirror for it to count. |
  |Get thrown out a window| <clr:#FFE669>(500 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Don't try this at home!!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "There IS a way to do this for free... just go to the crashed bus near the Cafe.")| There are two methods of doing this: You can annoy [MLG](mlg) with the [Airhorn](airhorn) gamepass in Goat Station. Or, as Noble stated, you can make [Stanley](stanley) throw you out the window at the [Cafe](cafe). There is a way to reach the bus without any items that increase your jump power.
  |Stare wistfully out the side window| <clr:#FFE669>(100 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Everyone always asks "what the dog doin'?" but never "HOW the dog doin'?"...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Sure, it was hard to program an entire phone, but how many people actually care?") | This likely requires you to be in first person to count.
  |Have a successful shift at the Cafe| <clr:#FFE669>(500 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Oh! I love their Vanilla Almond Milk!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "If only I had a car to get there with...") | <0px>(.) |

  ##[Trivia]
  - The items that can't be purchased but are part of the events are those that are only purchasable (and permanent) with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) or originally [Passenger Reputation](reputation).
    - Examples such as [Compass](compass), [Gas Station Coil](gas-station-coil), [Gas Station Ice Cream](gas-station-ice-cream) and [Flying Skillbook](flying-skillbook) all can be purchased with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) but aren't on the Shop.
    - Other items that are specifically limited / are now classified as unobtainable cannot be purchased in the <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) Shop, as well as items obtained through [NPCS](npcs).
      - Examples of this are the [Candied Cane](candied-cane), [Hoverboots](hoverboots), [Frozen Chocolate](frozen-chocolate), and [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror).
  - Items such as Liquid Void and Almond Water are not permanent when bought with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins), and are meant to be unlocked manually.
