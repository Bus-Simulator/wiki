  ##[Info]
  The Cup Dispenser is a gamepass item that allows you to create your own [coffee drinks](cafe-coffee) and give them to others (even players) on-the-go. When activated, it'll dispense an Empty Cup for up to 3 times, and will start regenerating all of them within a minute once no cups are left. Interacting with the Empty Cups will allow you to create any drinks just like within the [Cafe Event](cafe).
  \n\n 
  It's currently available for purchase as a gamepass, for 450 R$.
  \n\n 
  Its appearance is similar of that to the cup tray back at the [Cafe Event](cafe), but as a holdable item.

  ##[Custom Recipes]
  Main Article: [Recipe Book](recipe-book) 
  \n\n
  The Licensed Barista gamepass also gives you a [Recipe Book](recipe-book), allowing one to create their own recipes fitted with a name, description, and ingredients for up to 400 slots.

  ##[Trivia]
  - Its expensiveness is likely attributed to how you can still fufill orders from [NPCs](npcs) using the dispenser, effectively making this a reliable generator for [Reputation](reputation).
  - If you attempt to give a drink to someone who already has 3 cups, a pop-up will appear saying that they can't hold anymore drinks.
  - This is the first gamepass that includes two items in one, being the Cup Dispenser and the [Recipe Book](recipe-book).
