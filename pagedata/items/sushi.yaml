 ##[Info]
 Sushi is a collection of items obtained from the [Sushi Shop Event](sushi-shop), providing healing, or an array of special effects depending on if you buy or steal them with buying providing mostly beneficial effects, and stealing providing negative effects. Each sushi is randomized whenever you click on them and are all temporary.
 \n\n
 Some of these effects range from increased max health, to emergency healing, or knocking you up, and while some are hard-coded in specific values, some heal different amounts based on the server instance, so it may not be consistent.

 ##[Trivia]
  - This is the only non-permanent item that you can spend [Passenger Reputation](reputation) on. 
    - Not only that, but it's also the first item that modifies one's Max HP and providing a variety of effects like double jumping, making this one of the most unique items in the game.
