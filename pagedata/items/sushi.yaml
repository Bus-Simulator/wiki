 ##[Info]
 Sushi is a collection of items obtained from the [Sushi Shop Event](sushi-shop), providing healing, or an array of special effects depending on if you buy or steal them. Each sushi is randomized whenever you click on them and are all temporary.
 \n\n
 Some of these effects range from increased max health, to emergency healing, or knocking you up, and while some are hard-coded in specific values, some heal different amounts based on the server instance, so it may not be consistent.
