  ##[Info]
  The Flying Skillbook is a non-permanent item stolen from [GOATed Gas Station](/bussim/events/goated-gas-station). 
  \n\n 
  This item is simply meant to gate players from getting the [Helicopter](/bussim/items/helicopter) easily without having to pay, with its tooltip stating that it's glued shut. 
  \n
  It also doesn't have any other functionality aside from being purchasable for [100 Passenger Reputation](/bussim/others/reputation). 
  \n\n 
  If you do however pay for it, [Disc](/bussim/npcs/disc) will then unstick the pages allowing you to learn how to fly, it also gives you a permanent tool called [Helicopter](/bussim/items/helicopter). 
  \n\n 
  The cover reads: "how to FLY FREE 100% WORKING 2O22" along with a Dummy flying.

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Flying Skillbook is possibly one of the least functional items in any event, with [Tool](/bussim/items/tool) having no uses currently.
