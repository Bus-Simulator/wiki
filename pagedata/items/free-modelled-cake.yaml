  ##[Info]
  The Free-modeled Cake (or known as Birthday Cake) is a consumable item in Bus Simulator, gotten from everyone in the [Birthday Event](/bussim/events/birthday).
  \n\n 
  It has the same model and texture as the classic ROBLOX Cake. It doesn't heal nor reduce your health, and isn't a permanent item.
