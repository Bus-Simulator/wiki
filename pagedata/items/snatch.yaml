  ##[Info]
  The Snatch item is an item with the ability to pick up other players and throw them. This is only accessible through VIP servers or if you are an admin. However this item can be quite buggy at times under certain circumstances.

  You can also hold down LMB to charge up your shot, and releasing it will launch the player farther than normal.

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Snatch Item has the ability to pick people up at all times, even when inside a seat.
  - When a player tries picking up somebody while being held, typically this will override being held, dropping the player.
  - The Snatch Item can be used to noclip carried people through walls.
  - This originally was an item for NobleReign's other game being Kit Battle. This was then re-used to prevent scripting the same mechanic.
