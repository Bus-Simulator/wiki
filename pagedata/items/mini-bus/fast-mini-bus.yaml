  ##[Info]
  The Fast-Minibus is a VIP / Admin-Exclusive item in Bus Simulator that is a super outdated, but uniquely designed version of the regular Mini-Bus. 
  \n\n 
  The Fast Mini-Bus drives faster, but unlike the modern counterpart, it collides with non-collidable parts, and cannot drift. 

  ##[Appearance]
  The Fast-Minibus most notably has a pyramid at the front, giving an extra wheel at the front, as well as an additional, smaller pair of headlights, thrusters on the side, thrusters on the sides, a spoiler on the back, as well as two antennas on the back. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - The item used to be exclusive to the developers, as well as efeuc, which is known as the best driver in the Bus Simulator Lore.
