  ##[Info]
  The GPS is a Gamepass item in Bus Simulator. It costs 12 R$.
  \n\n 
  The location shown on the GPS is randomly generated, but some events have set locations to better reflect the situation. 
  \n
  All the locations can be seen [here.](gps-locations)

  ##[Trivia]
  - In The [Backwalls](backwalls), the GPS turns into a glitchy mess, unreadable and useless to the player.
  - If someone forces an event, the "Next event in (1-4)m" section of the GPS display will say "Next event in -9996m".
  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - If the GPS is held above the 5,000 stud limit, it'll always display "NO SIGNAL".
