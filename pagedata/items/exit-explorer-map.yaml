  ##[Info]
  The Exit Explorer Map is an item that is used within the [Backwalls](backwalls) to draw out areas you have already explored and marking the escape room with a large X. 
  \n\n 
  To obtain this, you must talk to [Red](red) within the [Backwalls](backwalls), and ask for Something Else. After asking him for an exit plus a cost of [5 Passenger Reputation](reputation), he will then give you the map.
  \n\n 
  Its appearance and function is exactly the same as the [Buried Treasure Map](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Explorer_Map#Buried_Treasure), with a large cross and a player locator for whoever holds the map.
