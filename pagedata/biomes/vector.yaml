  ##[Info]
  Vector is a biome in Bus Simulator submitted by Lunar (@MegaRacer5000). The biome is composed purely of vectors, being pure rays of light in the form of trees and housing. The floor and sky are pitch black.
  ##[Trivia]
  - The biome's structures use GUIs instead of parts, theoretically making this biome the only part-less biome with a proper ground.
