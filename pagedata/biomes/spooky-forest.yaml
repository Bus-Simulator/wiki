  ##[Info]
  Spooky Forest is a biome submitted by  NotFunnyClown (@orfriday36). It is a biome that takes place on a dark forest, with trees, bushes, tents, and rarely. That figure.
  \n\n
  The trees have a rare chance of containing a note stickered on its trunk, and very rarely, you can encounter that figure. It's harmless however. 
  ##[Trivia] 
  - Most likely the figure is just a reference to Slenderman. A classic horror character infamous during the 2009's.
