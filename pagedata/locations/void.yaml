         The Void is a medium-sized black room that has two monitors in the top-right corner with <a href='/bussim/npcs/efuc'>Efeuc</a> laying down next to them, 
         and a sign simply saying "back", 
         which being clicked or tapped on, 
         will take you back to the front of the second floor on the <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>bus</a>.

         <br><br>

         The location can simply be entered if you click or tap on the purple eye on the second floor.

        - name: The Void Box can actually be seen even on <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>The Bus</a> if you set your quality up to max whilst on the rooftop.
          children:
            - name: You can also try to get up there by using the <a href='/bussim/items/gas-station-gravity-coil'>Gravity Coil</a> + <a href='/bussim/events/space'>Space</a> trick, although the odds of landing is low, but possible.
              children:
                - name: If you do manage to land on top of it though, you'll also be immune to forced teleportation like the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a> for example.
