  ##[Info]
  The Void is a medium-sized black room that has two monitors in the top-right corner with Efeuc laying down next to them, and a sign simply saying "back", which being clicked or tapped on, will take you back to the front of the second floor on the bus. 
  \n\n
  The location can simply be entered if you click or tap on the purple eye on the second floor. 

  ##[Trivia]
  - The Void Box can actually be seen even on [The Bus](the-bus) if you set your quality up to max whilst on the rooftop. Only works in certain biomes due to fog.
    - You can also try to get up there by using the [Gravity Coil](gas-station-gravity-coil) + [Space](space) trick, although the odds of landing is low, but possible. 
      - If you do manage to land on top of it though, you'll also be immune to forced teleportation like the [Backwalls](backwalls) for example. This is later explained in the Technical Trivia. 

  ##[Technical Trivia]
  - The Void Box is located specifically above 5000 studs from [The Bus](the-bus) which puts it within the Height Immunity zone, in which events like the [Backwalls](backwalls) or [Acid Rain](acid-rain) will have no effect on you. Likewise, this also disables the [GPS](gps) from providing data.
    - This is also the same zone where [No Dough's house generation](no-dough) and [Glacier Cave](glacier-cave) are located, albeit higher than the Void Box.
