  | Quest | Reward | Description | Notes |
  |-------|--------|-------------|-------|
  |Win a Friday Night match against someone | <clr:#FFE669>(500 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "If you know me well enough, I'll let you play against me~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "If you see me in-game, just know that I won't back down.") | Challenging Pear counts for this quest. |
  |Sit in your seat for 3 minutes straight| <clr:#FFE669>(100 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Hope you're able to sit still!")\n\n <clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "i'm cooked....") | <0px>(.) |
  |Play the game for 15 minutes| <clr:#FFE669>(200 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "This one's a cakewalk~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Please?") | Simply just being in the game works. |
  |Chill in the Crystal Cavern for 5 minutes| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Sounds kinda familiar...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I love the acoustics there!!!" | You may need either a [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror) or an [event](glacier-cave) to do this. |
  |Get the Knife in Rock Gun Knife| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "It's like cheating, but legal!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "It's fair and balanced, right?") | The Knife appears after 4 rounds within Rock Gun Knife. |
  |Appreciate the X biome for 60 seconds| <clr:#FFE669>(200 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "A little nature goes a long way~!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I put a LOT of work into making these for you...") | Requires you to be within or on [The Bus](the-bus) while in said biome.\n\nBiome can be any within the game. |

  |Play a full round of Connect Four| <clr:#FFE669>(250 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "It'll be fun!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I like connect four") | It doesn't matter if you win or lose, simply playing a game will count. If somebody has the [Cartridge](cartridge), try asking them for a game. |
  |Stay on the windshield for 30 seconds| <clr:#FFE669>(125 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Try not to anger the driver~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "??? THATS SO DANGEROUS???")| It would be easiest to use [Cramped Cola](cramped-cola), and stand in between the windshield wipers to avoid getting wiped off. |
  |Drink five different types of soda| <clr:#FFE669>(320 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Thats a lot of soda...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Lemon-lime with REAL sugar... Bring back the Mist...") | The sodas that count are of the following:\n[- Cold Cola](cold-cola)\n[- Cola](cola)\n[- Bad Cola](bad-cola)\n[- Hot Cola](hot-cola)\n[- Cramped Cola](cramped-cola)\n[- Hyper Soda](hyper-soda)\n[- Lemon Soda](lemon-soda)\n[- Goala Cola](goala-cola)|

  |Give D6 a Bloxy Cola during the Cafe event| <clr:#FFE669>(199 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "They can have a little cola, as a treat~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I don't understand how they like that stuff so much...")| <0px>(.) |

  |Get thrown out a window| <clr:#FFE669>(500 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Don't try this at home!!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "There IS a way to do this for free... just go to the crashed bus near the Cafe.")| There are two methods of doing this: You can annoy [MLG](mlg) with the [Airhorn](airhorn) gamepass in Goat Station. Or, as Noble stated, you can make [Stanley](stanley) throw you out the window at the [Cafe](cafe). There is a way to reach the bus without any items that increase your jump power.
  |Stare wistfully out the side window| <clr:#FFE669>(100 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Everyone always asks "what the dog doin'?" but never "HOW the dog doin'?"...")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble (Archived) - "Sure, it was hard to program an entire phone, but how many people actually care?")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I wonder how many genuine, long-lasting connections were made in this game...")| This likely requires you to be in first person to count.

  |Survive a dangerous event| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "This one's just to keep you on your toes~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Soo, uhh... you're good at living, right?") | <0px>(.) |
  |Watch the TV in Noble's House for 30 seconds| <clr:#FFE669>(200 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "He's gotta get some use out of it somehow~!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I hope you'll be using the FRONT DOOR this time!!!") | <0px>(.) |
  |Get a score of at least 9 when playing the memory game| <clr:#FFE669>(400 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "It's on the table at the top of the bus!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I forgot what my high score was...

  |Explore away from the Bus for 3 minutes| <clr:#FFE669>(160 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Get out there and touch some grass!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "I'm a little sad how few people explore outside of the Cafe...") | <0px>(.) |
  |Thank or be thanked by somebody unique| <clr:#FFE669>(300 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "It's always proper etiquette to thank your driver~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "The rep system got out of hand so fast...") | <0px>(.) |
  |Bother the driver| <clr:#FFE669>(250 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Go on, be a nuisance~")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Wait, why do we want to annoy people?") | Being near the driver contributes to the quest. |
  |Aggro an entity, and then fully escape it without going invisible| <clr:#FFE669>(650 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Oh *pfffft*, that's not that hard with proper equipment.")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "Better grab the Almond Water...") | Escape an aggrovated entity by using [Almond Water](almond-water) right after being detected, and then run away as far as you can. |
  |Enjoy a X day for 5 minutes| <clr:#FFE669>(180 Coins) | <clr:#B9FF8A>(Pear - "Make sure to bring up how nice it is during small talk!")\n\n<clr:#85B1FF>(Noble - "My favorite weather is rain, since I don't get much where I am.") | X can be Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, or Stormy. |
