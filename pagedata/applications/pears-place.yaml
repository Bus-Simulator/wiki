  ##[Trivia]
  - The items that can't be purchased but are part of the events are those that are only purchasable (and permanent) with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) or originally [Passenger Reputation](reputation).
    - Examples such as [Compass](compass), [Gas Station Coil](gas-station-coil), [Gas Station Ice Cream](gas-station-ice-cream) and [Flying Skillbook](flying-skillbook) all can be purchased with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) but aren't on the Shop.
    - Other items that are specifically limited / are now classified as unobtainable cannot be purchased in the <clr:#FFE669>(Coins) Shop, as well as items obtained through [NPCS](npcs).
      - Examples of this are the [Candied Cane](candied-cane), [Hoverboots](hoverboots), [Frozen Chocolate](frozen-chocolate), and [Magic Mirror](magic-mirror).
  - Items such as Liquid Void and Almond Water are not permanent when bought with <clr:#FFE669>(Coins), and are meant to be unlocked manually.
  - Zeons line for the NoDough quest is a very loose reference to the video game franchise PAYDAY.
  - Zeons line for Connect Four is a reference to "It's time to duel!" from Yu-Gi-Ohs anime.
